## Overview

SailKit is an open-source toolkit for composing responsive email templates in
SvelteKit applications. It provides a set of Svelte 5 primitives and utilities
to help you create optimized and responsive production-ready emails.

## Why SailKit?

Email is notoriously challenging. crafting responsive, visually consistent
emails across various email clients and devices is not a trivial task. SailKit
simplifies this process by:

- Offering a clean and intuitive API for composing, rendering, and previewing
  email templates.
- Providing Svelte 5 primitives that feel natural and ergonomic to use.
- Translating your Svelte components into optimized MJML markup under the hood.
- Leveraging MJML's industry-standard email rendering engine to generate
  high-quality, responsive HTML that adheres to best practices.

### Why MJML?

[MJML](https://mjml.io) is an industry standard for composing email templates.
It provides a robust foundation that handles the complexities of email client
compatibility. Rather than reinventing the wheel, SailKit leverages MJML's
proven engine while providing a modern, Svelte-based developer experience.
